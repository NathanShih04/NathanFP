    "The test took me around an hour and ten minutes to complete in multiple sessions and there were definitely concepts that I was unsure of. I tried to take the test all on my own but had to reference google for a few of them. Some of these weaknesses I believe I can iron out and become better at once I get the concept down with more practice. \n",
